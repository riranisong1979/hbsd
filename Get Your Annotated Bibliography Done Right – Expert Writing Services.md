## Common Questions About Annotated Bibliographies

### 1. What is the difference between an annotated bibliography and a regular bibliography?

A regular bibliography simply lists the sources you’ve consulted for a research project. An annotated bibliography, on the other hand, includes a brief summary and evaluation of each source, helping readers understand its relevance and reliability.

### 2. How many annotations should I include in my annotated bibliography?

The number of annotations depends on the scope of your research. Typically, an annotated bibliography for a research paper may include anywhere from five to twenty sources. However, your professor may specify the exact number based on the assignment’s requirements.

### 3. Can you help with specific citation styles?

Yes! We are well-versed in all major citation styles, including APA, MLA, Chicago, and more. Just let us know which format you need, and we’ll ensure that your annotated bibliography is perfectly aligned with your professor’s guidelines.
